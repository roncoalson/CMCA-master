### Cannabis helps alleviate the symptoms associated with HIV treatments and HIV medications

More than 1.2 million Americans suffer from HIV.  Many people in Chicago use cannabis to help with their successful treatment. HIV is an approved qualifying condition to receive a medical cannabis card in Illinois. 

Some of the symptoms that HIV patients find cannabis helps with include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Weakness
* Loss of appetite
* Loss of weight
* Pain
* Aches in bones
* Swelling
* Lack of sleep
* High anxiety

Often, cannabis can be more effective than pharmaceutical drugs in alleviating the symptoms of HIV treatments. Illinois doctors now recognize cannabis as an effective tool to treat symptoms of HIV therapy.
