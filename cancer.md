### Cannabis helps alleviate the symptoms of cancer and can help with the side effects of chemotherapy

Thirty-nine percent of Americans are diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. Many people in Chicago use cannabis to help with their successful treatment and recovery. Traditional treatments for cancer, such as chemotherapy, have very debilitating side effects that cannabis can help mitigate. Any form of cancer is an approved qualifying condition to receive a medical cannabis card in Illinois.

Some of the symptoms that cancer patients find cannabis helps with include:

* Nausea and vomiting
* Weakness
* Loss of appetite
* Loss of weight
* Pain
* Aches in bones
* Swelling
* Lack of sleep
* High anxiety

Often, cannabis can be more effective than opioids and other pharmaceutical drugs in alleviating the symptoms of cancer. Illinois doctors now recognize cannabis as an effective tool to treat symptoms of cancer therapy.
